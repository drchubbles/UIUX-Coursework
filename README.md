# Hive UIUX Project (Demonstration Version)

Welcome to **The Hive**, a demonstration web application developed for a UI/UX coursework project, which is the Design, Develop, Deploy aspect as opposed to the Building / Home / Automation App. This application is a support system between university students and their personal supervisors, emphasising well-being and academic guidance. Please note that this application does not have full back-end functionality and instead utilises dummy data linked to two accounts: one from the student's perspective and one from the Personal Supervisor's perspective. The login details are shown below.

## Login Credentials

This system has **no backend**, so only two preset usernames are functional for demonstration purposes:

- **Student Account**  
  - **Username**: `Student`  
  - **Password**: _(any value)_  
  - Use this to explore the student interface.

- **Personal Supervisor Account**  
  - **Username**: `PersonalSupervisor`  
  - **Password**: _(any value)_  
  - Use this to explore the supervisor tools and reports.

> You can input these on the `LoginPage.html` file after launching the application in your browser.

## Project Overview

This project includes several HTML pages that simulate key functionalities:

- `index.html`: Landing page with basic instructions and a button to enter the app.
- `LoginPage.html`: Sign-in screen using preset usernames.
- `dashboard.html`: The dynamic homepage with panels tailored to either students or supervisors.
- `BookMeeting.html`: Booking meetings with or by a supervisor.
- `manageCalendar.html`: Manage personal supervisor availability.
- `messages.html`: A messaging/notification hub.
- `WBR.html`: Wellbeing Report submission form (student).
- `WBRPS.html`: Wellbeing Report viewer (supervisor).
- `SignUp.html`: Simulated sign-up page (not connected to a backend).

## Notes

- **Functionality is front-end only.**. There is no database or built storage system for users.
- Some features (like "Sign Up") are placeholders and not functionally connected. This would be done if I were to continue developing the app further, than for the sake of this project.
