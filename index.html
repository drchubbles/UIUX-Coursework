        <p>This user interface has been designed for the User Interface and Design Project. It has been carefully crafted to meet the needs of a student struggling at university and their Personal Supervisor. This Application is to form part of the UIUX Coursework. This project follows the Heuristic Guidelines and is built to be a user-friendly experience. This project is only a demonstration, so it has no backend functionality. To Sign in to a functioning student account, use the username Student (the password doesn't matter), and for the Personal Supervisor account, type PersonalSupervisor. The hive is called the hive as it is designed to encourage collaboration between the personal supervisor and students to create a healthy student experience.</p><br><p>Please enjoy!</p>
